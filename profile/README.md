Welcome to Gateway, a brige between Minecraft's servers and clients.

### An explanation of the project:
Gateway will make able to servers to send mod-like resources to the client. Well, with mod-like I mean that you would make anything you want, from custom GUIs to modify base game mechanics.

<br/><br/>

First client version will be relased as a mod (bc is easier) but I spect making a client in the future.

> **Note** I just started this project so I'm gonna be working on it slowly.
