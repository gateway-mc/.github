Welcome to Gateway, a bridge between Minecraft's servers and clients.

### Project Summary:
Gateway will make able to servers to send mod-like resources to the client. From custom GUIs to modify base game mechanics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is currently **abandoned** because I'm working on other projects. Maybe in the future I may return to this, or, hopefuly Mojang implements somthing like this in the core game. Who knows.
