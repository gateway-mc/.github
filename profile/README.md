Welcome to Gateway, a brige between Minecraft's servers and clients.

### Project Summary:
Gateway will make able to servers to send mod-like resources to the client. From custom GUIs to modify base game mechanics.

<br/><br/>

First client version will be relased as a mod (bc is easier) but I expect making a client in the future.

> **Note** 
> Won't be able to start with the development of the project at the time. (Nov 2023)
